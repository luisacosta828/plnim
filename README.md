# plnim

**Use Nim as a Procedural Language for PostgreSQL**

## Overview

**plnim** is a PostgreSQL language handler that lets you write PostgreSQL functions and procedures in the Nim programming language. Built on top of [pgxcrown](https://github.com/luisacosta828/pgxcrown), plnim offers a modern, safe, and productive way to extend your database.

## Features

### üöÄ Nim-Powered PostgreSQL Functions & Procedures
- Write PostgreSQL functions and procedures directly in Nim.
- Leverage Nim‚Äôs static typing and modern programming features for database development.

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Security by Design
- Built on pgxcrown, plnim enforces the use of safe, pure Nim code:
  - Only allows trusted mode (cannot run in PostgreSQL‚Äôs untrusted mode).
  - Functions are pure by design‚Äîno heap allocations, no global state, and no side effects.
  - Compile-time checks help prevent common bugs and vulnerabilities.

### üõ†Ô∏è Simple and Familiar Workflow
- Easy installation with Nimble and clear setup instructions.
- Automatic type mapping and glue code generation‚Äîfocus on your logic.

### üåê Cross-Platform Support
- Works on Linux, Windows, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- Handles platform-specific deployment details for you.

### üí° Open Source & Community-Friendly
- MIT Licensed.
- Welcomes issues, discussions, and contributions!

## Quick Start

---

### üö© **Try plnim instantly without installing Nim! (Perfect for curious developers)**

Don‚Äôt have Nim installed? No worries!

You can try **plnim** right away using Docker:

```bash
# Download the Dockerfile from this repository
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luisacosta828/plnim/master/docker/Dockerfile

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t plnim-demo -f Dockerfile .

# Start PostgreSQL with plnim ready to use
docker run --rm -p 5432:5432 plnim-demo
```

That‚Äôs it! You can now connect to PostgreSQL and start experimenting with Nim functions without setting up anything locally.

---

### 1. Install Nim and PostgreSQL

Ensure you have [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) and PostgreSQL installed.

### 2. Install plnim

```bash
nimble install pgxcrown
nimble install plnim
```

### 3. Register plnim in PostgreSQL

(Setup instructions for enabling `plnim` as a language handler will go here‚Äîsee documentation or examples.)

### 4. Write Nim Functions and Procedures

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION nim_add_one(a integer) RETURNS integer
AS $$
  return a + 1
$$ LANGUAGE plnim;

SELECT nim_add_one(10); -- returns 11
```

---

## Security & Safety

- **Pure Functions:** By enforcing Nim‚Äôs `func` (pure procedure) discipline, plnim prevents unsafe operations, memory leaks, and other vulnerabilities.
- **Strict PostgreSQL Integration:** Functions are registered as `STRICT` for safe handling of NULLs and argument validation.
